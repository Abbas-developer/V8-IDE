# V8-ide

This is a basic text editor built using the Tkinter library in Python.

## Features

1. **Text Editor:** The code creates a Tkinter window and a Text widget that serves as the code editor.

2. **Syntax Highlighting:** The code includes a function called `highlight_syntax` that implements basic syntax highlighting for Python code. It uses regular expressions to match keywords, strings, and comments and applies different tags to highlight them.

3. **Open File:** The code provides the functionality to open a Python file using the `askopenfilename` dialog. The selected file's contents are then displayed in the code editor.

4. **Open Folder:** The code allows opening a folder using the `askdirectory` dialog. It lists the files in the selected folder and changes the current directory to the chosen folder.

5. **Save and Save As:** The code enables saving the current contents of the code editor to a file. It provides options to save the file using `asksaveasfilename` dialog and to save the file with the same path if it was previously opened or saved.

6. **Run:** The code includes a `run` function that executes the Python script using `subprocess.Popen` and the `sys.executable`. It opens a new console window to display the output.

7. **Autocomplete:** The code implements a basic autocomplete feature using a Trie data structure. It suggests completions based on the entered prefix when the user presses the Tab key.

8. **Menu Bar:** The code creates a menu bar with options like "Open file," "Open folder," "Save," "Save As," and "Exit."

9. **Key Bindings:** The code binds certain key events to specific functions. For example, pressing Ctrl + S triggers the `save_as_w` function to save the file.

10. **Window Size:** The code determines the screen width and height and sets the size of the Tkinter window accordingly.

11. **Trie Implementation:** The code includes a Trie data structure implementation with methods for inserting words, searching words, and suggesting completions based on a given prefix.

## Usage

To use the text editor, run the script and a window will open with the editor interface. You can then perform actions such as opening files, saving files, running the script, and utilizing the autocomplete feature.
